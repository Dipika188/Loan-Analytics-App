# Loan-Analytics-App
The project aims to assess the performance of a system's data rendering capabilities under varying load conditions. Specifically, it focuses on measuring the amount of data rendered within a specified timeframe, such as the number of records displayed or the size of data transferred. By conducting performance tests, the project seeks to evaluate the system's responsiveness and scalability in handling large volumes of data. This assessment is essential for ensuring optimal user experience and system reliability, particularly in scenarios where the system must accommodate high data loads. Through iterative testing and optimization, the project aims to identify and address any performance bottlenecks, ultimately enhancing the system's ability to efficiently render data to users.
